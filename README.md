# Bank-Loan-Risk-Analysis-EDA-Assignment

This assignment aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business
scenario. In this assignment, apart from applying the techniques that you
have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of
risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is
used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

# Business Understanding

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for
loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are
associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results
in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default,
then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be
taken by the client/company):

Approved: The Company has approved loan Application

Cancelled: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either
the client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher
risk of the client, he received worse pricing which he did not want.

Refused: The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet
their requirements etc.).

Unused offer: Loan has been cancelled by the client but at different stages of the
process.

This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty
paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying
the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher
interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the
loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of
this case study.
